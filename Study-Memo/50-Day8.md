# Lecture 8 summary
## Differentiation algorithm
We learned about the different method of differentiation to calculate the gradient for deep learning. Backpropogation is the most efficient one as it avoid redundant calculation (as opposed as forward propogation)
## Types of neural network
- Convolutional neural network(CNN) can take in an input image, assign importance (learnable weights and biases) to various aspects/objects in the image and be able to differentiate one from the other. The pre-processing required in a ConvNet is much lower as compared to other classification algorithms.
- Recurrent neural network(RNN) can use the output of the previous time as the input of the current time and share the parameters. Very suitable for the processing of voice, text and other information.
